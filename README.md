# Setup and test locally
  
See the .travis file for information on how to test locally

# Setup and test with docker-compose on MacOS/Linux

## Build and exec into the dev container 

Make sure you have the latest versions of 

* docker
* docker-compose

```
git clone https://github.com/kbase/execution_engine2.git
cd execution_engine2
docker build . -t execution_engine2:test
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec ee2_with_ssh bash
# (This directory is linked to your pwd via the docker-compose file)
cd /ee2
make test-coverage
```

Once the docker image is built, it does not need to be rebuilt after code changes to rerun tests.
Just ensure the services are up, exec into the container, and run the tests.
